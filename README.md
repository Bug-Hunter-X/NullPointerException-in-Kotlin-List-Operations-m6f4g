# Kotlin NullPointerException in List Operations

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Kotlin when working with lists and null values. The example code shows a simple list operation but it lacks proper null handling.  This can lead to unexpected `NullPointerException` exceptions if the list contains nullable elements.

The `bug.kt` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.kt` provides a corrected version with proper null checks and safe call operators.

This repository highlights the importance of handling nullable values when working with collections to avoid runtime errors.
